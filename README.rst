TBMaLT is a PyTorch based **t**\ight **b**\inding **ma**\chine **l**\earning **t**\oolkit intended
to facilitate the development, testing, and deployment of fast and efficient machine learning
based tight binding models. This python toolkit aims to help reduce the overhead commonly
associated with the development of new models; and its modular nature reduces the complexity
of interfacing with existing models/codes.
